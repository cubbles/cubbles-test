<h1>Demo page for compound component <code>connectionhook-compound-i</code></h1>
<p>This compound component demostrate the global hookFunction between two member (<code>connectionhook-compound-e</code> and <code>connectionhook-compound-h</code>)
    The connection between the members is without hookFunction and the members are compound components.</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>connectionhook-compound-e</code> - component with internal connections with hookFunctions.</li>
    <li><code>connectionhook-compound-h</code> - component with internal connections without hookFunctions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Connected connectionhook-compound-e (component with hook function) with connectionhook-compound-h (component without connenction hook) without connection hook.</p>

<div cubx-core-crc class="container">
