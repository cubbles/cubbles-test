<h4>Connections</h4>
<ul>
    <li>connection between "member-a"/slot "a" and "member-b" slot "a" has a connection global hookFunction "cubx.hookFunctions.multiply10". (The function multiply payload with 10. The payload is a number.) </li>
    <li>connection between "member-a"/slot "b" and "member-b" slot "b" has a connection global hookFunction "cubx.hookFunctions.greeting". (The function include "Greeting" in first position to payload. The payload is a string.)</li>
    <li>connection between "member-a"/slot "c" and "member-b" slot "c" has a connection global hookFunction  "cubx.hookFunctions.fullName". (concat object attributes name and firstname to a object attribte name. The paylod is an object)</li>
</ul>
<p> The global functions are in the utility artifact <code>transform-function</code> defined.</p>
